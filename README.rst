Overall description
-------------------
Asynchronous finder of an exploit! With this script, you can scan any device that is reachable over
ICMP protocol. While scanning the selected target, this script will find a sensitive information
about the selected target, which will be used to find ready-made exploits and CVE. I encourage you to
use the discovered vulnerabilities to improve security of the scanned device, not to break
security of the scanned target.

Used Technologies
-----------------
* Python 3.10+

How to use exploit finder?
--------------------------
On Windows::

    python run_exploits_finder.py IP_V4_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE

On Linux::

    python run_exploits_finder.py IP_V4_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE

You can also specify the number of ports you want to scan::

    python run_exploits_finder.py IP_V4_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE -p 1024


Example usage::

    python run_exploits_finder.py 192.168.0.1 -p 2000


More detailed information about modules
---------------------------------------

Vulnerability Scanner Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- MAC Address detector
    This module will detect MAC address and vendor name of MAC used by the target.

- OS name detector
    This module will detect OS used by target.

- TCP Port scanner
    This module will discover this below information about the selected target:
        - open ports (what open ports selected target has)
        - names of services listening on these open ports
        - versions of these listening services

Scraper
^^^^^^^

- CVE scrapper
    This module will try to find a link to documents describing individual vulnerabilities
    discovered in the scanned target.

- Exploit scrapper
    This module will try to find a link to exploits that can exploit discovered vulnerabilities
    in the scanned target.
